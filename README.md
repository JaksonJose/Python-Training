# Python-Training

Fist of all, that is my first repository. So,I just learned how a plenty of thing works.

My system is a improviment of an Python excercise. The exercises purpose is to build a program that register names and ages in a external text file. I increased the function of create and delete file.

I learned how to create a program using modules and keep my coding more organized and clear. Other interesting things I learned was how to manipulate a external text file.
